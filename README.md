# My First approach with Nextjs, Redux, (RTK) and Typescript
# Simple Project calling https://www.thesportsdb.com/

Main Functionalities:

- Home Page Was redirected to Home
- Sports Bar with icons, redirecting to ID sport and showing Leagues corresponding to ID based on 
    - https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/usage/queries#selecting-data-from-a-query-result
    - This required two concurrently API calls. 
- Search Bar works with two diferent API Calls with concat (this is the best aproach? I'm not sure since I need to deal with diferent responses values, and seems a little fragil)
- I could't deal with some Typescript Props, special with some functions, url params, I opt to "any" props
- I've learn the main functionality of typescript and redux and some initial steps of nextjs
- I keept the OldAproach folders which means my first aproach with classic manual reducer-action-store and mapstateprops
- I know Next has built in fetch, I will try
